    "# Hello Spark!!!\n",
    "Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.\n",

    "- Notice the navigation and command buttons at top of the notebook. Press Play & Stop buttons to execute code and interupt execution.\n",
    "- Notice each cell has type. (Markdown, Code, Etc) This cell is a Markdown cell which is simply HTML informational vs Code cell allows you to execute against spark.\n",
    "- Notice each cell has desigination, for eample In [n]: the number is cell number. When you see In [*]: that means the cell is executing\n",
    "- To see all methonds available for object you can use Tab key Example Enter \"SC.\" press Tab and a drop down will appear.\n",
    "- To execute code in active cell press play button at top or you can use short cut keys Shift-Enter, Ctrl-Enter"

    "\n",
    "Apache Spark uses an abstraction for working with data called RDDs - Resilient Distributed Datasets. An RDD is an immutable fault-tolerant collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel. In Apache Spark all work is expressed by either creating new RDDs, transforming existing RDDs or using RDDs to compute results. When working with RDDs, the Spark Driver application automatically distributes the work accross your cluster.\n",

    "RDDs have actions, which return values, and transformations, which return pointers to new RDDs. Transformations are transformations that do not initiate execution on the cluster. A transformation is mapped in a Digital Acrylic Graph (DAG) which is used to optimize execution on the cluster which occurs at time of an action."
